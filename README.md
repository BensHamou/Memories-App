# Memories-App
A web application built with MERN stack, a place where you can share you memories and fun time with your friends and view theirs.

In this app I used the MERN stack to build the app, MongoDB for the database, Express for the back end/React for the frontend, and Node, I also used other tools like Redux and Material-UI.

This app is a place where you can share your day highlights and memories, pictures of your day with captions, and see your friend's memories, like and comment on them.
