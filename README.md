# Memories-App
A web application built with MERN stack, a place where you can share you memories and fun time with your friends and view theirs.

In this app I used the MERN stack to build the app, MongoDB for the database, Express for the back end/React for the frontend, and Node, I also used other tools like Redux and Material-UI.

This app is a place where you can share your day highlights and memories, pictures of your day with captions, and see your friend's memories, like and comment on them.

Here are some screens from the app
